// Expression statements are like declaration statements, but they don't introduce new identifiers. Instead, they perform an action, like calling a function or assigning a value to a variable. Here are some examples:

// Function call
console.log("Hello World");

// Assignment
var x = 5;
x = x + 1;
console.log(x);
