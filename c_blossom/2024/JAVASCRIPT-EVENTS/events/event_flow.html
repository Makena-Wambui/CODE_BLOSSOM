        When you click on this button, the click event will be triggered.
        This event occurs on the button, the button's container(div),
        and the entire webpage.

        Event flow explains the order in which events are received on the webpage:
            Starting from the element where the event occurs,
            and propagated thro the DOM Tree.

        2 kinds of event models:
            1. Event bubbling 
            2. Event capturing

        EVENT BUBBLING:
            - Event starts at the most specific element;
            - Then flows upwards to the least specific element; document object or window object.

            - So when the button is clicked, the event occurs in the following order:
                1. Button
                2. Div with id container
                3. Body
                4. Html
                5. Document
                6. Window

        EVENT CAPTURING:
            - Event starts at the least specific element;
            - Then flows downwards to the most specific element.

            - To enable event capturing, set the third parameter of the addEventListener() method to true.
            - The default value is false, which means the event will bubble up.

            - So when the button is clicked, the event occurs in the following order:
                1. Window
                2. Document
                3. Html
                4. Body
                5. Div with id container
                6. Button

        DOM LEVEL 2 EVENT FLOW:
        DOM Level 2 events specify that events flow through three stages:
            1. Capturing phase - Event trickles down from the window to the target element.
            2. Target phase - Event reaches the target element.
            3. Bubbling phase - Event bubbles up from the target element to the window.
