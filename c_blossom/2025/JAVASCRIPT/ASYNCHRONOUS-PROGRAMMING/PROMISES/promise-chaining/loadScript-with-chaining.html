      Each loadScript call returns a promise.

      Then it initiates the loading of the next script
      Hence scripts are loaded one after the other.
      We can add more asynchronous actions to the chain
      This code is still flat, it grows down not to the right. No pyramid of doom.

        we could add .then directly to each loadScript
        It still loads three scripts in sequence.
        But it grows to the right.
        This is not a problem for three scripts, but for more complex chains it may become hard to read.
        So we have the same problem as with callbacks.
