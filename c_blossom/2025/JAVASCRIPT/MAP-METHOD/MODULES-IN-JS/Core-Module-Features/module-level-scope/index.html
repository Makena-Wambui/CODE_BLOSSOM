            Each module has its own top level scope.

            The top-level scope of a module is not the global scope. In a module, top-level variables and functions do not become part of the global scope. They are local to the module.
            In other words, each module is a separate entity, and variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are only visible within that module by default.
            Top level variables and functions in a module are not seen in other scripts.
            
            In this example, we import two scripts - user.js and hello.js.
            hello.js tries to use user variable declared in user.js.
            But it can't, because each module has its own top-level scope.

            Modules should export what they want to be accessible from the outside. And import what they need.
