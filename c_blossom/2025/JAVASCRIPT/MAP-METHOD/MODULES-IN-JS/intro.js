/*
A module is simply a file.

A module is a file that contains code that can be imported and used in another file.
One script is one module.

Modules can load each other.
They use special directives import and export to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one.
    export - labels functions and variables that should be accessible from outside the current module.
    import - allows the import of functionality from other modules.
