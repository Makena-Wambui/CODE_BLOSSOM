An iterable is an object that can be iterated over.
This means it has a method that can retrieve one item at a time until all items are retrieved.

You make an object iterable by: 
    The object must have a method with the key Symbol.iterator
    This method must return an iterator.


An iterator is an object:
    That implements a next() method
    The next method returns an object with two properties:  
        value - which is the current value
        done - a boolean indicating whether iteration is complete.
