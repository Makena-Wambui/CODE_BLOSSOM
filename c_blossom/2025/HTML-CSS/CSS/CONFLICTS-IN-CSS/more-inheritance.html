        We have an ul element with two levels of unordered lists nested inside it.

        We will give the outer ul a border, padding and font color.

        color property is an inherited property.
        the color property valueis applied to ul's direct children (li elements) and to the indirect children (li elements inside the nested ul).

        we added a separate class to the inner ul element to override the inherited color property.
        This is inherited down through its children

        Properties like width, border, margin, padding are not inherited properties.
        If the border in our example was an inherited property, it means every single list and list item would have a border.
        This is an effect we don't want to achieve.
