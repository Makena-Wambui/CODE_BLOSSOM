        Inheritance is why a paragraph nested deep in the structure of your HTML is the same color as the CSS applied to the body.

        Understand how Cascade defines which CSS rules apply when more than one style block apply the same property with different values to the same element.

        There are 3 things to consider. Listed in increasing order of importance. Later ones overrule earlier ones.
        1. Source order
        2. Specificity
        3. Importance

        These 3 determine how browsers figure out exactly what CSS should be applied.

        1. Source Order
            If you have more than one rule, all of which have the same weight, then the one that comes last in the CSS wins.

            The rule that is nearer the element itself overwrites the earlier ones until the last one wins and gets to style the element

            Source order only matters when the specificity weights of the rules is the same.


        2. Specificity
            You will run into a situation where you know a rule comes later in the stylesheet but an earlier conflicting rule is applied.
            This is because the earlier rule has a higher specificity - its more specific and is being chosen by the browser as the one to style the element
            A class selector has more weight than an element selector.
            Hence the properties defined in the class style block will override those defined in the element style block.

            Note that it is not the entire rule that is overwritten.
            Only the properties declared in multiple places
            This helps avoid repetition in your CSS.
            Define generic styles for the basic elements.
            Then create styles for those that are different
            In our style sheet, we have generic styles for level two headings.
            Then created some classes that change only some of the properties and values 
            The values defined  initially are applied to all headings.
            Then the more specific values are applied to the headings with the classes.

    <h2>Heading with no class</h2>
    <h2 class="small">Heading with a class of small.</h2>
    <h2 class="bright">Heading with a class of bright.</h2>
  </body>
</html>
