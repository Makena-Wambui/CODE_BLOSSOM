        The CSS shorthand property  'all':
            Can be used to apply one of these inheritance values to almost all property values at once.
            Its value can be any one of the inheritance values:
                - inherit
                - initial
                - unset
                etc.
            A convenient way toun do all changes to styles so you can get back to a known starting point before beginning new changes

            We have two blockquotes.
            In the first, we apply styling to the blockquote element itself.
            The second has a class applied to the blockquote
               which sets the value of all to unset.

    -->

    <blockquote>This blockquote is styled.</blockquote>

    <blockquote class="fix-it">This blockquote is not styled.</blockquote>
