        Specificity is an algorithm that the browser uses to determine which property values should be applied to an element.

        Say you have multiple style blocks;
        These style blocks have different selectors 
        These selectors configure the same property with different values;
        while targeting the same element;
        specificity decides the property value that gets applied to the element.
        It is basically a measure of how specific a selector's selection/targeting is.
                An element selector is less specific.
                It selects all elements of that type that appear on the page.
                pseudo element selectors have the same specificity as regular element selectors.

                A class selector is more specific.
                It will select only the elements on a page that have a specific class attribute value.
                Has more weight than an element selector.
                Attribute selectors have the same specificity as class selectors.
                A pseudo class selector has the same specificity as a class selector.
