        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

        The term "cascading" is incredibly important to understand.
        The way that the Cascade behaves is key to underastanding CSS.

        When working on a project, you might find that the CSS you thought should be applied to an element is not.
        Often the reason for this could be:
          You created two rules that apply different values of the same property to the same element.
        Cascade and Specificity are mechanisms which control which rule is applied when there are conflicting rules.
        The rule that is styling your element may not be the one you expect.
        Thus, understand how these mechanisms work.

        Inheritance is also another key concept in CSS.
        It might cause some unexpected behavior.
        It means some CSS properties by default inherit values set on the current element's parent element and others do not.


        CASCADE:
            Stylesheets cascade.
            Simply put, this means the origin and the order of the CSS rules matter.
            When two rules both have equal specificity, the one that is defined last in the stylesheet is applied.
            Other advanced concepts such as cascade layers might also affect the cascade.
            In the example, we have two rules that could apply to the <h1> element.
              The h1 content ends up being colored blue
              Because both rules are from the same source, have an identical element selector, thus have the same specificity.
              Thus the last one in the source order is applied.
