        Some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their children.
        While other CSS property values set on parent elements are not inherited by their children.

        You may set a color and a font family on an an element.
        Every element inside that element will be styled with that color and font family.
        Unless you apply a different color and font value directly to them
    -->

    <p>
      As the body has been set to have a color of blue this is inherited through
      the descendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can change the color by targeting the element with a selector, such as
      this
      <span>span</span>.
    </p>

    <!--
        Some property values do not inherit
        For instance if you set a width of 50% on a parent element,
        all its descendants will not inherit that width.

        In summary, the three concepts: cascade, specificity and inheritance are what determine which CSS applies to what element.
