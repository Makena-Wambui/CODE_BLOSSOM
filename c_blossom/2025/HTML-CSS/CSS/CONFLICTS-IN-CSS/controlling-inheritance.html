        CSS provides five special universal property values that can be used to control inheritance.
        Every CSS property can accept these values, but they are not applicable to all properties.
        1. inherit - sets the property value apllied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element.
                    turns on inheritance.
        
        2. initial - sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as the initial value of that property.
                    
        3. unset - sets the property value applied to a selected element to the value it would have had if no styles had been applied to it.
                    acts like inherit if the property is inherited, and like initial if it is not.
        4. revert - reset the property value applied to a selected element to the value it would have had if no styles had been applied to it.
                    ie the browser default styling.
                    acts like unset if the property is inherited, and like initial if it is not.
        5. revert-layer - resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value it would have had if no styles had been applied to it.
                        acts like revert, but only for the current layer of styles.


        Let us look at a list of links and explore how these universal values work.

      <li>Default <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
      <li class="my-class-1">Inherit the <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
      <li class="my-class-2">Reset the <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
      <li class="my-class-3">Unset the <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
