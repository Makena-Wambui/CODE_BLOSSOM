        Combinators are also selectors.
        They allow us to combine selectors in a way that selects elements based on their location in the DOM relative to other elements.
        eg child or sibling.

        Descendant combinator:
            Represented by a single space character.
            Combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor element that matches the first selector.
            Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called a descendant selector.
