        Represented by (~)
        If you want to select siblings of an element even if they are not directly adjacent

        For ex, to select all <img> elements that come anywhere after <p>, we would:
            p ~ img {
            }

        In this example we select all <p> elements that come after <h1>
            Even though there is a <div> in the document also, the <p> that comes after it, is selected as well
    -->

    <article>
      <h1>A heading</h1>
      <p>I am a paragraph</p>
      <div>I am a div</div>
      <p>I am another paragraph</p>
      <div>
        I am another div.
        <p>I am targeted separately</p>
        <p>I am also targeted separately</p>
      </div>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
