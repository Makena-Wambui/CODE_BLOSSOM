        Child combinator is represented by a (< ) placed between two CSS selectors.

        Matches only those elements matched by the second selector that are the direct children of elements matched by the first selector.
        Descendant elements further down the hierarchy do not match.

        To select only <p> elements that are direct children of <article> elements:
                article > p {
                }
    -->
    <ul>
      <li>Unordered item</li>
      <li>
        Unordered item
        <ol>
          <li>Item 1</li>
          <li>Item 2</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
