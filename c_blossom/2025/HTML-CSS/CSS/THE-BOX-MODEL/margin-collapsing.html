        Two positive margins will combine to become one margin.
        The size of that margin will be equal to the larger of the two margins.

        Two negative margins will collapse and the smallest of the two will be used. smallest as in furthest from 0.

        If one margin is negattive and the other is positive, its value will be subtracted from the other and the result will be used.

        We have two paragraphs.
        The top paragraph has a margin-bottom of 50px
        The other paragraph has a margin-top of 30px
        The margins will collapse together so the actual margin between the boxes is 50px and not 80px.
