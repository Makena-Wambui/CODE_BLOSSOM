    <!--
        Box model behavior fully applies to block boxes
        Some of the properties can apply toinline boxes also, such as those created by a span element

        We have a span inside a paragraph
        We have applied a width, height, padding, border and margin to the span
        But the width and height properties do not apply to inline boxes
        The top and bottom margin, padding and border are respected
        But dont change the relationship of other content to the inline box
        The padding and border overlap other words in the paragraph
        The left and right margiin, padding and border are respected
        They move the inline box away from the other content
    -->

    <p>
      I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. A
      span is an inline element and so does not respect width and height.
