        Everything in CSS has a box around it.
        Understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to allign items with other items.

        In CSS, we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the categories of block boxes and inline boxes.
        The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page.
        Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type.
        You can set various values for the display type using the display property, which can have various values

        If a box has a display value of block:
            The box will break onto a new line
            Width and height properties are respected
            Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.
            If width is not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container.
                in most cases the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
            Some HTML elements such as h1 and p use block as their outer display type by default


        If a box has a display type of inline:
            The box will not break onto a new line
            Width and height properties will not apply
            Top and bottom paddings, margins, borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
            Left and right padding, margins, borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
            Some HTML elements such as a, span, em, strong use inline as their outer display type by default

      INNER AND OUTER DISPLAY TYPES:
        Block and inline display values are said to be outer display types.
        They affect how the box is laid out in relation to other boxes around it
        Boxes also have an inner display type - dictates how elements inside that box are laid out.
        You can change the inner display type by changing the inner display value for ex, display: flex
        The element will still use the outer display type block, but the inner display type will be changed to flex.
        Any direct children of this box will become flex items and will behave according to the Flexbox specification.
        Will learn more about inner display values that boxes can have, like flex and grid when I learn about CSS Layout
