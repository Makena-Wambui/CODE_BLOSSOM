        The border is drawn between the padding and the margin of a box.

        If using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the content box.

        If using the alternative box model, the size of the border is included in the width and height of the content box.
        This means the bigger the border, the smaller the content box,
        because the border will take up some of the available width and height of the element box.

        We have a large number of properties for styling borders
        There are four borders
        Each border has a style, width, and color that we might want to manipulate individually


        To set the properties of each border individually, we can use the following properties:
        border-top
        border-right
        border-bottom
        border-left

        To set the width, style and color of all sides use:
        border-width
        border-style
        border-color

        To set the width, style and color of an individual side use:
        border-top-width
        border-top-style
        border-top-color
        border-right-width
        border-right-style
        border-right-color
        border-bottom-width
        border-bottom-style
        border-bottom-color
        border-left-width
        border-left-style
        border-left-color
