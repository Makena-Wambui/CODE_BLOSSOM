        Margin, border and padding are shorthand properties
        Allow us to set all four sides of the box at once.
        These shorthands also have equivalent longhand properties.
        These give us control over the four sides of the box individually.

        MARGIN:
        The invisible space around your box
        Pushes other elements away from the box
        Margins can have negative values or positive values
        Setting a negative margin value can pull the box closer to other elements and cause overlap
        Whetehr using the standard or alternative box model, margin is always added after the size of the visible box is calculated
        You can use the margin property to control all margins of an element at once,
          or each side individually using equivalent longhand properties ie margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left
