        inline-block is a special value of display
        provides a middle ground between inline and block
        use it if you do not want an item to break into a new line,
        but want it to respect width and height and avoid overlapping.

        an element with display: inline-block will do a subset of what a block element does:
        - it will respect width and height
        - padding, margin and border will be applied and will cause other elements to be pushed away from it

        - but it will not break into a new line
        - will only become larger than its content if width and height are set
    -->

    <p>
      I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. A
      span is an inline element and so does not respect width and height.

    <!--
        inline-block is useful when you want to give a link a larger hit area by adding padding
        <a> is an inline element like <span>
            use display: inline-block to allow padding to be set, making the link larger and easier for a user to click on it
            This is seen fairly frequently in navigation bars

        in the example below, the navigation is displayed in a row using flexbox
        we add padding to the <a> element as we want to change the background color when <a> is hovered
            the padding appears to overlap the border on the <ul> element because <a> is an inline element
    -->

    <nav>
      <ul class="links-list">
        <li><a href="">Link One</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Link Two</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Link Three</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </body>
