        Attributes provide additional information about an element that is being marked up.

        Attribute selectors are used to target elements with specific attributes.

        The first type: Presence and Value Selectors.
            These enable the selection of an element based on the presence of an attribute alone - for example href;
            or the presence of an attribute with a specific value - for example href="https://www.google.com".

        Examples of presence and value selectors:
            1. [*attr*] - a[title] - matches all <a> elements with a title attribute (regardless of its value). the attribute is in the square brackets.

            2. [*attr*=*value*] - a[href="https://www.google.com"] - matches all <a> elements with an href attribute whose value is exactly "https://www.google.com".

            3. [*attr*~=*value*] - p[class~="special"] - match all p elements that have a class attribute whose value is exactly special or contains special as a space-separated value.

            4. [*attr*|=*value*] - p[lang|="en"] - matches all p elements with a lang attribute whose value is exactly "en" or starts with "en" immediately followed by a hyphen. for example, "en-US".
