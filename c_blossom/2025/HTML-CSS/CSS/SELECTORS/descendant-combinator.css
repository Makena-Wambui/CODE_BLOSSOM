/*

The descendant combinator is typically represented by a single space character between two selectors. 
It matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
Ancestor could be parent, parent of parent, parent of parent of parent, and so on.
Selectors that utilize the descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.
The descendant combinator is the most widely used combinator in CSS.

/*
The descendant combinator is technically one or more CSS white space characters;
  the space character and/or one of four control characters: carriage return, form feed, tab, or line feed;
between two selectors in the absence of any other combinator.

The white space characters that comprise the combinator may also contain any number of CSS comments.
