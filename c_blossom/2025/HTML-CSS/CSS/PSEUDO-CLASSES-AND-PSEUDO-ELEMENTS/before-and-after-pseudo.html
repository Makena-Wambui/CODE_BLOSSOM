        There are special pseudo-elements in CSS, ::before and ::after, that can be used to insert generated content before or after an element's content.
        They are used along the content property to insert content into your doc using CSS.
        In our example below, we use them to insert a string of text.
        Doing this however is not something we do often, as this text is inaccessible to some screen readers.
        Could also be hard to find and edit in the future.

        We could use these pseudo-elements to insert icons, decorative images, or other content that is not critical to the page.
        For example, we are insering a little arrow here that is just a visual indicator that we do not need to be read by screen readers.

        They are also used to insert an empty string which can be styled to create shapes, lines, or other decorative elements.

    <p class="arrow-end">This is a paragraph with a little arrow at the end.</p>

    <p class="arrow-start">
      This is a paragraph with a little arrow at the start.
    </p>

    <p class="empty-string">The empty string comes before this.</p>
