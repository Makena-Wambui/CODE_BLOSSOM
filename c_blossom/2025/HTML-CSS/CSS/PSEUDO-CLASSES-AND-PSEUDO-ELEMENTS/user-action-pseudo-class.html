        Some pseudoclasses only apply when the user interacts with the document.
        These are called user action pseudoclasses.
        Or dynamic pseudoclasses.
        They act as if a class has been added to the element when the user interacts with it.

        :hover - applies if the user moves their pointer over the element, usually a link.

        :focus - applies if the user focuses the element by clicking or using keyboard controls.
