    <!--
        Pseudo elements behave in a similar manner to pseudo-classes.
        They act as if you have added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.
        They start with two colons (::) followed by the name of the pseudo-element.
        example - ::before, ::after, ::first-line, ::first-letter

        If you wanted to select the first line of a paragraph, you could wrap it in a span element and use an element selector to style it.
        But this would fail if the number of words you wrapped with span was longer or shorter than the parent element's width.
        We tend to not know how many words will fit into a line of text, since this will cahnge as the screen width or font size changes, so we can't predict how many words to wrap in a span.
        Thus HTML doesnt really help us here.

        The ::first-line pseudo-element selector will do this for you.
        It allows you to style the first line of a block-level element, such as a paragraph.
        If the number of words increases or decreases, it doesn't matter, the ::first-line pseudo-element will always style the first line of the element.
