        We have two nested lists.

        Both are identical.

        Only difference is that one has a class of ems and the other has a class of rems.

        First we set 20px as the font size of the html element

        Recap: 
        em means my parent element's fontsize if used for the font-size property
        it means my own font size if used for everything else like padding, margin, etc.

        The li elements inside the ul element with a class of ems take their sizing from their parent element's font size, which is the ul element.
        So each successive level of nested list will get progressively larger

        rem means the root element's font size
        The li elements inside the ul element with the class rems take their sizing from the root element, html
        So each successive level of nesting does not get larger

        If you change the html's font size, everything else changes relative to it, both em and rem sized text.
