        There are various numeric value types in CSS.
        The following are all numeric value types:
        1. <integer> - a whole number, e.g., 0, 1, 2, -1, -2

        2. <number> - a decimal number. May or may not have a decimal point with a fractional component - 10, 10.5, -10.5

        3. <dimension> - a number with a unit attached to it. 45deg, 10px, 5s. An umbrella category for other types - <length>, <angle>, <time>, <frequency>, <resolution>, <flex>, <percentage>.   

        4. <percentage> - a fraction of another value - 50%, 100%, 0.5%. Always relative to another value.
                        - an elemnt's length is relative to its parent element's length
