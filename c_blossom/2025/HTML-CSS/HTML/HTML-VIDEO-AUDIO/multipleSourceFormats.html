        We have taken the src attribute out of the actual video tag
        Instead we have used separate <source> elements that point to their own sources.

        The browser will go through the source elements, and play the first one it can support
        Including WEBM and MP4 sources should be enough to play your video on most platforms and browsers nowadays.

        Type attribute: optional but advisable that you include it.
            It contains the MIME type of the file that <source> points to.
            Browsers can use type to immediately skip over videos they do not recognize.
            If type is not included,browsers will load and try to play each file till they find one that works.
                This obviously takes time, and is an unnecessary use of resources.

    <video controls>
      <source src="cat-swim.avif" type="video/avif" />
      <source src="cat-swim.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

      <p>
        Your browser does not support this video. Here is a link to the
        <a href="cat-swim.avif">video</a>
        instead.
