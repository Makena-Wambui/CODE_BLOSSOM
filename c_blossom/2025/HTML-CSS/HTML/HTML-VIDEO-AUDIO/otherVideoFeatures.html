        Use width and height attributes to control the video size, or use CSS.
        Whichever one you choose, videos mantain their native width-height ratio, also known as aspect ratio.
        If aspect ratio is not mantained by the sizes you set, the video will grow to fill the space horizontally, then the
        unfilled space will just be given a solid bg color by default.

        autoplay so that the video or audio starts playing right away while the rest of the page is loading.
        Advised not to use this, as it can be really annoying.

        loop makes video or audio start playing again whenever it finishes.
        only use when necessary.

        muted causes the media to play with the sound off by default.

        poster is the url of an image which will be displayed before the video is played. image is used as a splash screen or advertisng screen

        preload - for buffering large media files.
             none - do not buffer the media file.
             auto - buffer the media file
             metadata - buffer only the metadata of the file.

    <!--
    Note if autoplay is included, then you will not be able to see the poster.
