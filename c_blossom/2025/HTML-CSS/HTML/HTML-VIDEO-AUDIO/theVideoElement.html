        The video element allows you to embed a video easily.

        src(source) attribute to indicate the path to the video.

        controls attribute;
            users must be able to control video and audio playback.
            Use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your own interface using a JS API.
            At a minimum, the interface must include a way to stop and start the media, and to adjust the volume.

        The paragraph inside the video tags:
            This is the fallback content.
            Will be dispalyed if the browser accessing the page does not support the video element.
            This provides a fallback for older browsers.
            It can be anything you like.
            In our case we have provided a link to the video so the user can access it no matter what browser they use.
