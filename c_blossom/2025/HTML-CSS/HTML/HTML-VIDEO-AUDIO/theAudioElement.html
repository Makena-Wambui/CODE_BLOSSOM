        The audio element works just like the video element, with only a few differences.
        Takes up less space than a video player, as there is no visual component.
        You only need to display contols to play the audio.

        Does not have the width and height attributes. As there is no visual component. Hence nothing to assign a width/height to.

        Does not support the poster attribute, because of the same reason. No visual component.
