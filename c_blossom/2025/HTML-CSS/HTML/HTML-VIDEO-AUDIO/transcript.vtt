Peaches, the cat, meowing.
Come on , Peaches
That's better...
Yeah...
There we goo...
Go, go, go!

00:00:09 --> 00:00:26
Like most cats, Peaches doesn't love the water. But what he does love is the problem. Peaches loves eating and sitting. He became overweight, contracted diabetes, and refuses to go for walks. We were in a condo.. we didn't make it of our hallway coz he just kinda flopped over and decided it wasn't going to happen.

00:00:027 --> 00:00:33
He needs to do something.
His vet says he has to lose two kilograms.
The pool was the answer because here it's hard to be lazy.

00:00:34 --> 00:00:44
He is pretty mellow when he is on his platform on the water
Its really only when he's being asked to exert himself that he kind of meows.

00:00:45 --> 00:00:52
As bizarre as it may be for a cat to be put in water, it makes sense for Peaches.
His owner happened to be friends with a pet hydrotherapist.

00:00:53 --> 00:00:44
So they kind of pick him up take him to one end, and hehe swims to his platform, and so they try and do that a couple times without break. Like I said to get his cardio up.
