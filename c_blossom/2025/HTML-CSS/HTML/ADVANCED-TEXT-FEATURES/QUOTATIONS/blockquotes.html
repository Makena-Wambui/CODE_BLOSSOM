    <p>
      If a section of block level content such as a paragraph, multiple
      paragraphs, or a list is quoted from somewhere else, wrap it inside a
      &lt;blockquote&gt; element to signify this. Then include a URL pointing to
      the source of the quote inside a cite attribute.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
      <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates the enclosed text is an
      extended quotation.
    </p>

    <!--
        Let us turn the above into a block quote.

        Browser default styling will render it as an indented paragraph to indicate that it is a quote.
    -->

    <p>Here is a blockQuote:</p>

    <blockquote
      cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote"
    >
      <p>
        The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or
        <em>HTML Block Quotation Element</em>) indicates the enclosed text is an
        extended quotation.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
