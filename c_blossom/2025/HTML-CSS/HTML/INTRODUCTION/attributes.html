    Elements can also have attributes.
    They look like this:

    -->
    <p class="editor-note">The weather is very nice today</p>

    <!--
    class="editor-note" is an attribute.
    Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.

    There should be a spsce between the attribute name and the element name.
    If an element has more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces.

    The attribute name should be followed by an = sign.

    The attribute value shd be wrapped in opening and closing quote marks.
