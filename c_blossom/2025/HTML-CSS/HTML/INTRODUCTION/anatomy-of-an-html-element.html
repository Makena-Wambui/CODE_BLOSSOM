    Take a look at this paragraph element:
            <p>The weather is nice today</p>

    The anatomy of our element is as follows:
        1. Opening tag: Consists of the name of the element(in our case p for paragraph) wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.
            Marks where the element begins or starts to take effect.
            In our case, the opening tag is <p>.
                It precedes the start of our paragraph text.

        2. The content: This is the content of our element.
            In our case, the content is The weather is nice today.

        3. Closing tag: Similar to the opening tag, but includes a forward slash before the element name.
            Marks where the element ends or stops taking effect.
            In our case, the closing tag is </p>.
            It follows the end of our paragraph text.


    So the element is the opening tag + content + closing tag.
