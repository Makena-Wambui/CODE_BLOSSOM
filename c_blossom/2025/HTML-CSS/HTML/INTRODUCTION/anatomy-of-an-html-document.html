    Individual HTML elements are not very useful on their own.
    Individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page.

    1. <!DOCTYPE html> - 
    This is the first line of an HTML document. 
    It is a declaration that tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in. 
    This is the HTML5 declaration. 
    <!doctype html> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. 
    Older versions of HTML had longer doctypes.

    2. <html></html> -
    This is the <html> element
        It wraps all the content on the page.
        Also called the root element.

    3. <head></head> -
        This is the <head> element.
        It acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.
        This includes keywords and a page description that are used by search engines and would appear in search results,
        character set declarations, CSS to style the page, and more.

    4. <meta charset="UTF-8" /> -
        This is the meta element.
        The meta element represents metadata that can not be represented by other HTML meta  related elements like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.
            The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of your HTML document as UTF-8. UTF-8 includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages.
            With this setting, the page can handle any textual content you may include.
            Set this to avoid problems later on. 

    5. <title></title> -
        This is the title element.
        Sets the title of your page
        This is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.
        The page title is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.

    6. <body></body> -
        this is the body element.
        It contains all the content that displays on the page that you want to show to web users when they visit your page.
        It includes text, images, videos, games, audio tracks, and more.
