    What is HTML?
        Stands for Hypertext Markup Language
        A markup language
        Tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
        Consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap or mark up different parts of content tomake it appear or act a certain way.
        The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to link to another page, italicize words, make a font bigger or smaller, etc.

        Example:
        Consider this line: The weather is nice today.
        If we wanted this line of text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph,
        by enclosing it in a paragraph(<p>) element:
    -->

    <p>The weather is nice today</p>

    <!--
    Tags in HTML are not case sensitive.
    They can be written in uppercase or lowercase.
    For example, all these tags would work: <title>, <TITLE>, <Title>, <TiTlE>.
    However, the standard is to write tags in lowercase for readability and consistency.
