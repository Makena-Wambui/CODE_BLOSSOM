    Sometimes attribute values are written without quotes.

    The element below, <a> is called an amchor.
        Anchors enclose text and turn them into links
        href attribute specifies the web address the link points to.
        If you are only going to have the href attribute you can write the element like this:
    -->
    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">My favorite website</a>

    <!--
    The anchor can also have a title attribute - a description of the linked page.

    We get errors if we add the title element the same way we added the href attribute above.
    <a href=https://www.mozilla.org title=The Mozilla Website>My favorite website</a>

    The browser mistakes this as three attributes: title with a value of The, and two boolean attributes, Mozilla and Website.
    You can hover over the link to view the title text.
    Always include attribute quotes to avoid this error. It also results in more readable code.

    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org" title="The Mozilla Website"
      >My favorite Website</a
