    Sometimes attributes are written without values. This is acceptable. These are called boolean attributes.

    When a boolean attribute is written without a value, or with any value, like 'false', the boolean attribute is always true.
    If the attribute is not written in an html tag, the boolean attribute is false.

    Consider the disabled attribute that you can assign to form input elements.
    We use this to disable the form input elements so the user cannot make entries
    Disabled elements typically have a greyed out appearance.
    -->

    <input type="text" disabled="disabled" />

    <!-- Shorthand for the above to prevent user from entering text into the input box -->
    <input type="text" disabled />

    <!--
     No disabled attribute so text input is allowed
    -->
    <input type="text" />
