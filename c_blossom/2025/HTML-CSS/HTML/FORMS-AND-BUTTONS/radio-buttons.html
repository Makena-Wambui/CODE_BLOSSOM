      The 'name' attributes for each set of radio buttons have to contain the same value,
      to associate them together as one set.
      If the name attributes contain different values, then they will effectively be different sets of radio buttons,
      and will have different values on submission to the server.

      Include a 'value' attribute that contains the value to be submitted to the server when the radio button is selected.
      name/value pairs are submitted to the server when the form is submitted.
      So for our example, the server will receive a name/value pair of 'hotel=economy' if the 'economy' radio button is selected.

      The label for each radio button should describe that particlar value choice, rather than the overall group of radio buttons.
      To describe the overall value choice, wrap it in a fieldset element.
      This element takes a legend element as a child.
      The legend contains the overall description of the radio button group.

      The checked attribute has been applied to the first radio button,
      so that when the page first loads that button is selected by default.
      This shows that this hotel room type section is required.
      One option will always be selected by default.
      To deselect the default selection, the user must select another option.
