    <!--
        The default behavior of a button in a form element is to submit the form,
        unless form submission is blocked by client side form validation, due to invalid input.

        You can specify a button's behavior using the button's type attribute.
        The type attribute can have one of the following values:
        - submit: To explicitly declare that a button should behave like a submit button.
                Not necessary to decalre this unless you have other buttons inside your form,
                and you want to make it clear which button should submit the form.

        - reset: creates a reset button.
                Immediately deletes all data out of the form, resetting it to its initial state.
                These type of buttons are more annoying than useful, so avoid using them.
        - button: creates a normal button like the ones used outside of forms.
                By default they do nothing.
                JS is needed to give them functionality.
