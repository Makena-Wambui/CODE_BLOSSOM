        A basic form contains three things:
           1. A form element.
              Which wraps all of the other form content.
              Any form controls inside the <form></form> tags are part of the form, 
              and their data is included when the form is submitted.

            2. One or more pairs each consisting of a label element,
            and a form control element, usually an input element, but there are other types of form controls such as select element.
            Form control element allows the user to choose or enter some data that will be sent to the server when the form is submitted.
            The label element provides an identifying label associated with the form control describing the data that should be entered.

            3. A button element for submitting the form.

            Our example below is used to ask for a user's name and email to sign them up for a newsletter.

            The form element attributes:
                1. action
                    a path to the page we want to send the submitted form data to, for processing.
                2. method: 
                     the data transmission method we want to use to send the form data to the server.
                     'get' value causes the data to be sent as parameters attached to the end of the URL.

            The input elements:
                represent the different data items entered into the form.

                Attributes:
                   type - specifies the type of input element to display.
                         - specifies the type of form control to create
                         there are many different types of form controls from simple text fields of different types,
                         to radio buttons, checkboxes, and more.
                         type text renders a basic text field that can accept any value.

                         name - the name of the data item.
                         On form submission, the data is sent as name/value pairs.
                         See this: http://localhost:5500/c_blossom/2025/HTML-CSS/HTML/FORMS-AND-BUTTONS/submit-page?name=emma&email=emma%40gmail.com
                         So as for the name - value pairs sent to the server: the name is equal to the value of the name attribute,
                         and the value is equal to the data entered in the field.

                    id attribute - this is an id that can be used to identify the element.
                                    in our case, it is used to associate the form control with its label.

                    required attribute - this attribute makes the field required.
                                         The form cannot be submitted unless the required fields are filled in.
                                         Dont set on optional fields.


                    NB: Some input types don't get their value from text entered into the field.
                        input type="color" renders a color picker widget that you choose a color from.
                        input type="radio" renders a radio button that can be selected, or deselected.
