    This is implemented using input type="checkbox" controls.
    
    Unlike radio buttons, checkboxes allow multiple selections.

    Radio buttons and check boxes are implemented in a very similar way.
    Check boxes can also take checked attributes so that they are pre selected when the page loads.

    They also behave in a similar fashion.
    Except that radio buttons allow you to select 0 or one option from a group of options.
    While checkboxes allow you to select 0 or more options from a group of options.
    Also while radio buttons have the same value for the name attribute, check boxes have different name values.
    They also are generally not given value attributes.
    This means check boxes represent different data values.
    While a radio button set represents the same data value.
    On submission, each value is submitted with a value of on if the checkbox is checked.
    If the checkbox is not checked, the value is not submitted.
    If you checked for example yoga and kungfu, the name/value pairs submitted to the server would be yoga=on and kungfu=on.
