    <!--
    Label elements provide identifying labels associated with form controls,
    that describe the data that should be entered into them.

    You can put whatever text content you like in label elements.
    But labels should accurately describe what data the associated form control expects.

    You create an association between the label and the form control by giving the conrol an id attribute,
    then you give the label a for attribute whose value is the same as the value of the control's id attribute.
    -->

    <!--
       This is an example of an explicit form label.
       The association between label and control is made explicitly via the for and id attributes.
    -->
    <label for="name">Name (required):</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required />

    <!--
      You can implement an implicit form label by nesting the control inside the label element.
      You no longer need the for and id attributes to associate the label and control.
    -->

    <label>
      Email (required):
      <input type="email" name="email" required />
    </label>
