    This text is not marked up in any way.
    When viewed on the browser it appears as a huge chunk of text.

    This is because there are no HTML elements to give the text structure. The browser does not know what is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.

    WHY DO WE NEED STRUCTURE?
         1. A user looking at a web page tends to scan the page quickly for relevant information. He often starts by looking at the headings to get an idea of what the page is about.
         And if they can not see anything useful within a few minutes, they tend to leave the page.

         2. Search engines indexing your page use the contents of your headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search ranking.
         Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of search engine optimization.
         
         3. Visually impaired people do not read web pages in the same way as sighted people. They listen to them instead.
         They use screen readers that read out the content of the page to them.
         Among the technics that screen readers use to help visually impaired people navigate a page is to read out the headings first.
         This allows their users to quickly get an idea of the structure of the page and to navigate to the relevant sections.
         Without headings, they would be forced to listen to the entire page to get an idea of its structure.

         4. To style your content with CSS, or to make it do fun stuff with JS, have elements wrapping the relevant content so CSS/JS can easily target them.

    Quick hummus recipe This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.
    It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over
    the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and
    Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta
    breads. Ingredients 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) 175g of
    tahini 6 sundried tomatoes Half a red pepper A pinch of cayenne pepper 1
    clove of garlic A dash of olive oil Instructions Remove the skin from the
    garlic, and chop coarsely Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper,
    and chop coarsely Add all the ingredients into a food processor Process all
    the ingredients into a paste. If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process
    it for a short time If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer
    time For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of
    lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or
    spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you. Storage
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to
    use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy,
    you should definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing; you
    should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
