    <h2>Chapter 1: The Lion's Den</h2>

    <p>
      Once upon a time, in the heart of the jungle, there lived a lion named
      Simba. He was the king of the jungle and was feared by all the animals.
      Simba was a proud lion and he loved to show off his strength to the other
      animals. He would often roar loudly to show how powerful he was.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: The Pig's Pen</h2>
    <p>
      In the same jungle, there lived a pig named Porky. Porky was a friendly
      pig who loved to play with the other animals. He was not as strong as the
      lion, but he was loved by all the animals in the jungle.

    <h3>Porky's Dream</h3>
    <p>
      Porky had a dream of becoming friends with the lion. He wanted to show
      Simba that he was not afraid of him and that they could be friends. Porky
      knew that the lion was powerful, but he believed that he could win him
      over with his kindness.

    BEST PRACTICES:
        1. Use one <h1> per page. This is the top level heading.All other haeings sit below it in the hierarchy.

        2. Use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy.
        Dont use h3 to represent subheadings, followed by h2 elements to represent sub-subheadings.

        3. Unless it is completely necessary, do not use more than three of the heading levels in a single document.
        Documents with many levels are difficult to read and navigate. In such a case, consider spreading the content over multiple pages.
