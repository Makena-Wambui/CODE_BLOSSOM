    This span element has no semantics.
    
    We use it to wrap content when we want to apply CSS to it. Or to do something with it using JavaScript. It does not give the content any extra meaning.

    We applied some CSS to it to make it look like a top level heading. But it has no semantic value hence it is not treated as a heading by screen readers or search engines.
