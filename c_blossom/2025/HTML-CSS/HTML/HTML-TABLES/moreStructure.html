      Adding more structure with <thead>, <tbody> and <tfoot> elements

    <!--
        Your table might get a bit more complex in structure.
        It is useful to give them more structural definition.
        One way to do this is by using <thead>, <tbody> and <tfoot> elements.
            They allow you to markup the header, body and footer sections of a table.
    
    These elements do not necessarily make the table more accessible to screen reader users.
    They dont add any visual enhancements to the table on their own.
    However, they are very useful for applying styling and layout enhancements via CSS, which can make the table more accessible.

    Use them in the following order:
     1. <thead> must wrap the part of the table that is the header
          this is usually the first row with the column headings.
          if using col/colgroup elements, the table header should come right after them.

    2. <tbody> must wrap the main part of the table content, that is not the header or footer.
          this is usually the rows with the data.
          Note: tbody is always included in every table implicitly, even if you don't write it in the HTML code.
          So why should you include it?
           It gives you more control over the table's structure and styling.

    3. <tfoot> must wrap the part of the table that is the footer.
        For example, this might be a final row with totals or summary information.
