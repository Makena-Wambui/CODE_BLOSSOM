    <!--
        A structured set of data made up of rows and columns.

        Allows you to easily and quickly look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data eg a list of students and their grades, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.

        A table is rigid.

        Information is easily interpreted by making visual associations between row and column headers.
