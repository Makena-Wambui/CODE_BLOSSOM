        It is okay to nest one list inside another list.
        For example, you might want to have some sub bullets sitting below a top level bullet
    -->

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>

      <!--
        The last two bullets are very closely related to the bullet before them, they are like sub instructions that fit under the fourth bullet.
        It makes sense to nest them in their own unordered list, and put thet list inside the fourth bullet.
      -->
      <li>
        Process all the ingredients into a paste.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
          </li>
          <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
