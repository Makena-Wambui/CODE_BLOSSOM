        Description Lists are used to mark up lists of items where each item has a description or definition.

        For instance terms and definitions, questions and answers, etc.

        Below is an example of a set ofterms and definitions:

        We use <dl>(description list) element for wrapping aroung all terms and definitions
            A <dt>(description term) element for wrapping around each term
            A <dd>(description definition) element for wrapping around each definition

        The browser default styles will display description lists with the descriptions somewhat indented to the right of the terms.
