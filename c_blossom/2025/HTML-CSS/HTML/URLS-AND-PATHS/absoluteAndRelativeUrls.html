    <title>Absolute And Relative URLS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      An absolute URL points to a location defined by its absolute location on
      the Web, including protocol and a domain name.
    </p>

    <p>
      Say you have a file, <code>index.html</code> that is uploaded to a
      directory called <code>projects</code> that sits at the root of a web
      server,<br />
      and the website's domain is <code>https://www.example.com</code>.<br />
      The page would be available at
      <code>https://www.example.com/projects/index.html</code>.<br />
      Or just <code>https://www.example.com/projects</code> since most web
      servers are configured to serve the <code>index.html</code> file by
      default.<br />
      An absolute URL will always point to the same location no matter where it
      is used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relative URLS point to a location that is relative to the file you are
      linking from. <br />

      Relative URLS point to different locations depending on the actual
      location of the file they are used in.
