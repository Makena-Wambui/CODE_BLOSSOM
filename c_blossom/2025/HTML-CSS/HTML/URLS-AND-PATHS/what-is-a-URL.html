    <dl>
      <dt>URL - Uniform Resource Locator.</dt>
      <dd>
        A string of text that defines where something is located on the Web. For
        instance:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mozilla's English homepage is located at the URL
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
              >https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            The URL for Google's homepage is
            <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      URLS use paths to find files.<br />
      Paths specify where the file you are looking for is found in the file
      system.

        Let us consider the following directory structure:
         Say you have a directory called creating-hyperlinks. This is our root directory.
            When working locally with a website, you will have one directory that contains the entire website. This directory is called the root directory.
    
        Inside the root directory we have the following:
            File 1 - index.html; which would be our homepage or landing page in a real website.
                        A landing page is a web page that serves as the entry point to a website or a particular section of a website.
            File 2 - contacts.html
            
            Two directories:
                Directory 1 - pdfs, which has a single pdf file - project-brief.pdf
                Directory 2 - projects, which has an index.html file. This would be the main landing page for project related information.
                NB: you can have two different index.html files for the same project as long as they are in different filesystem locations.


            SAME DIRECTORY.
                You want to include a hyperlink inside the top level index.html that points to contacts.html.
                You just specify the filename you want to link to, because it is in the same directory as the current file

            MOVING DOWN TO SUBDIRECTORIES:
              If you wanted to include a hyperlink in the top level index.html that points to projects/index.html, you would specify the path to the file you want to link to.
              path = projects/index.html

            MOVING UP TO PARENT DIRECTORIES:
               If you are in projects/index.html, and want to include a hyperlink to pdfs/project=brief.pdf,
               you would have to go up a directory level to the root directory, then down to the pdfs directory.
               To go up a directory, use ../ so our URL would be ../pdfs/project-brief.pdf
