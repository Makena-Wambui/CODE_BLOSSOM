    <!--
        The line break element(<br>) creates a line break in a paragraph
        It is the only way to force a rigid structure in a situation where you want a series of short fixed lines; for example in a poem or a postal address.
        It is a void element and does not have a closing tag.

        In the poem below, without the <br> elements, the poem would be rendered as a single line of text, since HTML ignores most white spaces.

    <h2>My Poem</h2>
    <p>
      Roses are red,<br />
      Violets are blue,<br />
      Sugar is sweet,<br />
      And so are you.<br />
