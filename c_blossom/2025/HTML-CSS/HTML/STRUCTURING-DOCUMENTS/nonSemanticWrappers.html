        Sometimes you might not find an ideal semantic element for wrapping content or grouping items together.
        Sometimes you might want to group some elements together so as to affect them all as a single unit using CSS or JavaScript.

        Use <div> and <span> elements to group elements together when there is no ideal semantic element for the job.
            Use preferrably with a suitable class attribute, to provide some kind of label for them so that they can be easily targeted with CSS or JavaScript.

        <span> is an inline non semantic element.
            use it when you can not think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or dont want to add any specific meaning
    
        <div> is a block level non semantic element.
            Only use when you cant think of a better semantic block level element to wrap your content, or dont want to add any specific meaning.

            Imagine a shopping cart widget that you could choose to display on the left or right side of the page.
            You could wrap the entire widget in a <div> element and give it a class of 'shopping-cart' so that you can easily target it with CSS.
