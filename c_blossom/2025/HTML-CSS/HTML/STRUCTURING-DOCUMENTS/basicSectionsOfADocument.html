        Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another.
        But they all tend to share similar standard components.

        1. Header
            - Usually a big strip across the top, with a big heading, a logo, and perharps a tag line.
            - The header is usually the top part of a webpage.
            - It usually contains the logo, the name of the website, and the main navigation menu.
            - It is usually consistent across all pages of a website; stays the same as we move from one page of the website to another.

        2. Navigation Bar
            - These are links to the website's main sections.
            - Usually represented by links, tabs or menu buttons.
            - Just like the header, this content remains consistent from page to page.
            - Avoid having inconsistent navigation on your website.
            - Many designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header, and not a separate component.
            - Having the two separate is better for accessibility, since screen readers can read these two better if they are separate.

        3. Main Content
            - A big area in the centre that contains most of the unique content of a web page eg a video you want to watch,
            the main story you are reading, map you are looking at, etc.
            - Definitely varies from page to page.

        4. Sidebar
            - Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc
            - Contextual to what is contained in the main content.
                For example, on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, links to related articles, etc.
                But there are cases where you might find some recurring elements such as a seconday navigation bar, a search bar, etc.
            - It is usually on the left or right side of the main content.
            - It is not always present on a webpage.

        5. Footer
            - A strip across the bottom of the page.
            - Generally contains fine print, copyright notices or contact info.
            - It is a place to put common infor, just like in the header. However this infor is not critical or just secondary to the website.
            - Also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.
            - The bottom part of a webpage.
            - Contains info that is not necessarily unique to the page, but is important for the website as a whole.
            - Usually contains contact info, copyright info, links to privacy policy, terms of service, etc.
            - Like the header, the footer is usually consistent across all pages of a website.

        HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent these sections of a webpage.
        These tags are called semantic tags.
        They are called semantic because they give meaning to the content they wrap around.
        They help search engines, screen readers, and other devices understand the content of a webpage better.
        here are some of the semantic tags that you can use to represent the basic sections of a webpage:
            - <header> -> Represents the header of a webpage.
            - <nav> -> Represents the navigation bar of a webpage.
            - <main> -> Represents the main content of a webpage. Contenet subsections are represented by <article>, <section> and <div> tags.
            - <aside> -> Represents the sidebar of a webpage. Often placed inside the <main> tag.
            - <footer> -> Represents the footer of a webpage.
