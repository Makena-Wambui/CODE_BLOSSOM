  <body>
    <!--
        <main> - for content that is unique to that page.
            - use <main> only once per page.
            - put directly inside <body> tag.
            - ideally <main> should not be nested within other elements.
        
        <article> - encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page like a single blog post

        <section> - similar to article.
            - But more for grouping together a single piece of the page that constitutes a single piece of functionality(eg a mini map or a set of article headlines) or a theme.
            - Best practice to begin each section with a heading.
            - You can break  <article>s up into different <sections>, or <section>s into different <article>s depending on the context.
                
        <aside> - contains content that is not directly related to the main content, but can provide additional information indirectly related to it.
            eg glossary entries, autor biography, related links, etc.

        <header> - represents a group of introductory content
            - If it is a child of body, it represents the global header of the page.
            - If it is a child of an article or section, it represents the header of that specific section or article.

        <nav> - contains the main navigation functionality for the web page.
            - It is a collection of links for navigating the website.
            - It is not a collection of links to other websites.
            - It is not a collection of links to other parts of the same page.
            - Secondary links should be placed in <aside> element not in <nav> element.

        <footer> - rep a group of end content for the page.
            - If it is a child of body, it represents the global footer of the page.
            - If it is a child of an article or section, it represents the footer of that specific section or article.
