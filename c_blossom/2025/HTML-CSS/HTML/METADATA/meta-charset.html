    What is metadata?
        Metadata is data that describes data

    We use the <meta> element to add metadata to an HTML document

    1. Character encoding: Use the meta element to specify your document's character encoding, that is the character set the document is permitted to use.
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />

        utf-8 is a universal character set.
        It includes pretty much any character from any human language
        This ensures that your web page is able to handle displaying any language
        Good idea to set this on any web page you create; for example this web page can handle japanese and english just fine
