    The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed on the web browser when the page is loaded.

    It contains metadata information: the page <title>, links to CSS if you are going to use CSS to style your HTML content,
        links to custom favicons, and other metadata information(data about the HTML such as the author, and important keywords that describe the document)
    Web browsers use information contained in the head to render the HTML Document properly.

    
    The HTML head is the contents of the <head> element.

    The contents of the <body> element are displayed on the browser when the page is loaded
        The head's content is not displayed.

        The head's job is to contain metadata about the document.

        The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
