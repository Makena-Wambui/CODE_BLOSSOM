        To further enrich your site design, you can add references to custom icons in your metadata.
        These icons will be displayed in certain contexts, such as when a user bookmarks your site or saves it to their home screen.

        Favicon is the most commonly used icon.
        It is short for favorites icon.
        This is a reference to its use in the favorites or bookmarks list in web browsers.
        Favicons are displayed in the browser tab containing each open page, and next to the bookmarked pages in the bookmarks list/panel.
        
        This is how you can add it to your page:
            Save it in the same directory as the site's index page, in .ico format, although other formats are supported(like .png or .gif).
            Add this line in your HTML's <head> block to reference it:
