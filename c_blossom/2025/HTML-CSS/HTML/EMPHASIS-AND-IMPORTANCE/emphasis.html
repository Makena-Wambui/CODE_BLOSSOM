    In written language, we tend to stress words by putting them in italics

    In HTML, we use the <em>(emphasis) element for these instances.
        Makes the document more interesting to read.
        Also recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice.
        Browsers style this as italic by default.
        But dont use <em> purely to get italic styling. For this you can use a span element with some CSS, or an <i> element.
