      In order to put an image on a web page, we use the
      <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a void element - it can not have any child content or have a closing
      tag.
    </p>

    <p>It has two attributes: <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code>.</p>

    <p>
      <code>src</code> attribute contains a URL pointing to the image we want to
      embed in our page.<br />
      The URL can be an absolute URL or a relative URL.<br />
      Without <code>src</code> attribute, <code>&lt;img&gt</code> has no image
      to load.
    </p>

    <p><img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" /></p>

    <p>
      Search engines also read image filenames and count them towards SEO.<br />
      Give your image a descriptive filename: dinosaur.jpg better than image.jpg
    </p>

    <p>You could emebed the an image using it sabsolute URL.</p>

    <p>
      <img
        src="https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Longhaired-Dachshund-standing-outdoors.jpg"
        alt="wiener-dog"
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      Elements like <code>img</code> and <code>video</code> are sometimes called
      replaced elements.<br />
      This is because the element's content and size is defined by an external
      resource such as an image or video file,<br />
      not by the contents of the element itself.
