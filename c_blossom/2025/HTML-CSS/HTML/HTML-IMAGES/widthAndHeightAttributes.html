      You can use <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes of the
      <code>img</code> element<br />
      to specify the width and height of your image.<br />
      Provide their values as integers without a unit;<br />
      They represent the image's width and height in pixels.
    </p>

    <p><img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="A Massive T-Rex" /></p>

    <p>
      <img
        src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
        alt="A Massive T-Rex"
        width="400"
        height="300"
      />
    </p>
    <!--Suppose we have some text after the image like this:-->
    <p>
      Why do we need to specify width and height?<br />

      The HTML for your page and the image are separate resources that are
      fetched by the browser as separate HTTPS requests.<br />
      The browser starts to display the HTML to the user as soon as it receives
      it. <br />
      If the images have not yet been received, which is often the case,<br />
      as image files are often larger than HTML files,<br />
      the browser will only render the HTML, and will update the page with the
      image once the image is received.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the image is loaded, the browser adds the image to the page.<br />
      The image takes up space, so the browser has to move the text down the
      page<br />
      to accomodate the image above it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moving the text like this is extremely distracting, especially if the user
      had already started reading.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you specify the size of the image in your HTML,<br />
      using width and height attributes, then the browser knows,before it even
      downloads it,<br />
      the space it has to allow for it.<br />

      So when the image is downloaded, the browser does not have to move the
      surrounding content.

        But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely lighted aquarium
        she imagined it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with schools of
        tiny, delicate animals floating and dancing slowly to their own serene
        currents and creating the look of a living painting. That was wrong, in
        any case. The ocean was different from an aquarium, which was an
        artificial environment. The ocean was a world. And a world is not art.
        Dorothy thought about the living things that moved in that world: large,
        ruthless and hungry. Like us up here.
